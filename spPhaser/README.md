# Soundpipe Phaser

This is a simple wrapper around the <em>sp_phaser</em> module from [Soundpipe]("https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe). It provides a stereo-in, stereo-out phase-shifter effect.

**Note** to build this module, you must clone the [Soundpipe]("https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe), to a folder which is a sibling to your *synthedit-modules* folder.

The SynthEdit project file *spPhaserDemo.se1* illustrates how to use this module.
