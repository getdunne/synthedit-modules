# SynthEdit .vcxproj template
The Visual Studio project template file included with SynthEdit 1.3 is not ideal, as it generates project files for VS2010 not 2017, and the post-build event copies SEM files to locations other than where I want them.

Substitute the enclosed *XX_TEMPLATE_XX.vcxproj* file under e.g. *C:\Program Files\SynthEdit 1.3\template* to get nicer *.vcxproj* files for your SEMs.
